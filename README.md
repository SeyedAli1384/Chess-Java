My work ends here because I really enjoyed creating this game for my university’s second semester project.
Building a clean game using Java and JavaFX feels so good.
Around 30% of this project was coded with the help of AI (I didn’t want to fully learn JavaFX, so I got some assistance).

Here are some strong points of this project:

1. Dynamic castling logic that works for both Standard and Chess960 game modes.
2. Multiple piece themes (just convert them to .png and add them).
3. Ability to freely add your own board themes.
4. Timer, game mode options, and board rotation feature.
5. Move notation panel.
6. Draw handling (50-move rule, insufficient material, stalemate).
7. Hidden Easter egg / fun extras.
8. I don’t know—you tell me!

Here are some weak points of this project:

1. En passant move doesn’t work correctly when the board rotation option is enabled.
2. No PreMove feature.
3. Move notation doesn’t show en passant moves.
4. Draw handling covers most situations, but not all.
5. I don’t know— Feel free to find more issues in my code.
